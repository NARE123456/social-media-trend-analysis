# social-media-trend-analysis
📊 Project Explanation – Interactive Social Media Dashboard 🎯 Objective  The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that analyzes social media trends across multiple platforms (Google, Instagram, Twitter). It helps in visualizing user engagement, search trends, and activity patterns in one place.
⚙️ Workflow

Data Collection & Cleaning

Collected raw datasets from Google, Instagram, and Twitter.

Removed duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns.

Normalized data formats (dates, numerical values).

The cleaned datasets are stored as CSVs (google_clean.csv, instagram_clean.csv, twitter_clean.csv).

Dashboard Development

Used Python, Plotly, Dash inside VS Code to make interactive charts.

Each platform has its own dashboard tab showing different insights.

A combined dashboard compares all platforms together.
